# Raspberry

Raspberry is a delicious Gulp and React boilerplate that makes front-end development easier.

### What does it do?

* Starts server on localhost:8080
* Reloads webpage automatically while you work
* Styling: Convert LESS to CSS, adds vendor prefixes, concatenates and minifies to build.css
* Javascript: Uses Babel for ECMAScript 6, converts React's JSX to JS, outputs to build.js
* Builds application to a build folder
* Deploys build folder to github pages. Be sure to update the remote url!

### Getting Started

* `git clone` this repository
* `npm install` to install the dependencies
* `npm start` will run gulp and kickoff the server
* `npm run build` will build your application to a build folder
* `npm run deploy` will deploy your build folder to the github repo's gh-pages branch.
