# Raspberry

Raspberry is a delicious Gulp and React boilerplate that makes front-end development easier.

### What does it do?

* Starts server on localhost:8080
* Reloads webpage automatically while you work
* Styling: Convert LESS to CSS, adds vendor prefixes, concatenates and minifies to build.css
* Javascript: Uses Babel for ECMAScript 6, converts React's JSX to JS, outputs to build.js

### Getting Started

* `git clone` this repository
* `npm install` to install the dependencies
* `npm start` will run gulp and kickoff the server
